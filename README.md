# Appointments

An iOS mobile application to book a meeting appointment with professors in your college

There are two sets of users, a professor, and a student. A professor can register, add their weekly office hours and schedule to the application and similarly a student can register and add their student information to the application. A student can select a professor he/she would like to meet, select the available time-slot from their schedule and send an appointment request. Professor receives a push notification to accept/reject the appointment request. Students receive a push notification when their appointment has been accepted/rejected.
